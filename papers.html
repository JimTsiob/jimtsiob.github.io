            <h4>Perception! Immersion! Empowerment!
                Superpowers as Inspiration for Visualization</h4>
            <p>
                In this paper the authors have created a study about using certain Superpower concepts which are used in comic books to <br>
                create better visualizations. The concepts are 7 and they are the following: <br>
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enhanced vision: which is essentially a way for humans to see things from a different viewpoint
                than the casual eye can perceive. 
                </li>
                <li> Visual synesthesia: Make non-visual phenomena visual. </li>
                <li> Enhanced attention: Identify details (no matter how important) in visualizations. </li>
                <li> Enhanced numeracy: the ability to count visualized phenomena. </li>
                <li> Enhanced recall: connect observations to prior ones or to other information. </li>
                <li> Enhanced comparison: Find similarities/differences between things. </li> 
                <li> Enhanced prediction: Have the ability to make better predictions. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> With all these in mind the authors suggest several ideas on how visualizations can be improved <br> 
                providing readers with better insights and help them make better predictions. <br>
                What I liked about this paper is that the ideas are actually pretty solid, the authors mention the usage of computer vision <br>
                and several other tools to enhance visualizations based on the above concepts. Also, the paper's visualizations are very well drawn <br>
                in the form of comic book boxes, making the paper fun to read and stimulating the reader. <br> 
                It's the only paper I've read with this style of visualization <br>
                 </p>
